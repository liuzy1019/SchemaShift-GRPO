"""PROVE-style state-machine task generation.

LLM-in-the-loop at every turn: the LLM sees domain + tool schemas + live state
+ full execution history, and decides the next action (tool_call with arguments,
or terminal).  Oracle trace is the recorded interaction — no heuristic parameter
inference needed.

Pipeline per task:
  1. create_session(seed) — fresh isolated state
  2. LLM generates user_query
  3. Loop (max_turns):
     a. LLM decides next action: tool_call(name, args) | final_answer | report_error
     b. Execute tool_call against live MCP → record observation
     c. Apply execution perturbations (intermittent errors, pagination, …)
     d. Append to history
  4. Derive success criteria from state delta
  5. Replay validation against fresh session
  6. Robustness knobs applied post-generation
